# old-projs
## A repo to track my old personal projects before Aug 2022.
1. Nov 2020- was inspired seeing bots on discord, so created a personal one for some essential tasks- invites, ban, kick..
2. May 2022- created a scrpit that uses keystrokes at intervals to play a classic P2E game on Solana. 
3. June 2022- python quiz script, that copies the question and searches on google and moves the cursor at the top for you to copy the answer and paste.
4. Some other small projects in between which does not need mentions:)
